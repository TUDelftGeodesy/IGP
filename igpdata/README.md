# IGP data

The `igpdata` directory is meant as the location for the original datasets. 
It can also be a placeholder, contain symbolic links to the original data, or can be empty. 

This directory is kept separately, to enable the use by different projects, and the efficient update by newly acquired data. 
It is not necessary to use this directory, the data may also be stored elsewhere.
