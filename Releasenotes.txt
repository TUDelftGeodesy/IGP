2024-11-27 by FvL
- Resolves known issue in the prediction module with co-located points 
- MHT: Minor update to mht_setup_models.m
- STMMAIN: Major updates to stmexport.m and stmpredict.m, added clustering of points, added a 
  check on the spatial overlap between the input and output point locations, and converted 
  all crs descriptions to EPSG codes for consistency.

** Release 1.0b0, 7 July 2024 ** 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Beta release to NAM

Known software issues:
- The prediction module has some known issues with co-located points (major, under investigation)
- Not all plot functions have a saveplt option (minor, for next release)
- Insar reduction may output "empty" shallowLos component (minor, easy work around via settings, but
  needs further investigation)

Known data issues:
- Only tested with waddenzee data (v6 and v7)
- In v7, the newly added Schiermonnikoog levelling dataset causes a singularity during integration,
  has been excluded (temporarily) from the integration
- Not (yet) tested with Groningen data (only older software versions)
- Test on simulated data not yet ported to this version 

Changes since previous release:

2024-07-04 by HM:
- IGPTEMPLATES: moved templates to new folder, added many new comments (e.g. what's next)
  to scripts, many examples of plotting stmplot_examples.m
- IGPPROJECTS: redone processing after many changes to the software on existing datasets (v6),
  started new project folder with processing for updates datasets (v7)
2024-06-18 by HM
- STMMAIN: cupido2stm remove points with less than opt.minObs(=2) observations
- STMUTIL: many improvements to stmplotseries, stmplotvel and stmtrans
2024-05-16 by HM
- STMUTIL: implementation of several S-transformation methods for stmplotseries
2024-03-14 by HM
- STMUTIL: added subdirectory with shapefiles for basemaps
2024-03-07 by HM
- STMINTEGRATE: major modifications
- STMMAIN: several minor modifications
- STMUTIL: several minor modifications
2024-01-08 by FvL
- STMREDUCEINSAR: major modifications  
     + numLevels now consistent between variables (obsData, stochModel, sensitivityMatrix)
	 + numLevels now a variable
	 + separation between deep and shallow is now an option (for some  datasets the shallow 
	   part was all nan's)
2023-10-27 by HM
- STMMAIN: updated stmreduceinsar (minor fix in datasetId)
2023-10-26 by HM
