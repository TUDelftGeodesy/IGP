** Release 1.0b1, 2 December 2024 ** 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second Beta release to NAM

Open issues
-----------

Known software issues:

[2 Dec 2024 by FvL, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Addition of export to geotiff and shapefile/geopackage in stmexport.m
[8 Aug 2024 by HB, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Tooltip is sometimes not accessible in stmplotmap because it is hidden behind another layer with markers.
[25 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Medium , Assigned to HM] 
    Make it possible to use output space time matrix from an integration run as input for a next integration run
    to enable two step approaches.
[25 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    The computation of test statistics does not use the full co-variance matrix of the residuals. This 
    seems to have little impact on the results, but was never investigated in depth and subsequently
    forgotten.
[11 Jul 2024 by HB, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Plots in RD as option 
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Stmvelocity sometimes gives warnings about badly conditioned normal equations. Most of the time this
    is only a warning, but somtimes action is taken to make the normal equations regular. This doesn't seem
    to affect the results. The underlying cause is not very clear, it could be covariances matrices stored
    as single precision, or data with large standard deviations.
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Not all plot functions have a saveplt option
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Insar reduction may output "empty" shallowLos component (easy work around via settings, but
    needs further investigation)

Known data issues:

[8 Aug 2024 by HB, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    The last station in the GNSS eventTable was added in 2018. All stations added after this date use the
    default receiver and antenna. It would be nice to add these new stations explicitly. There are also
    a few minor differences with the NAM tables.
[25 Jul 2024 by HB/HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    The output from the integration module has sometimes spikes, probably caused by East/Up decomposition
    for points with only levelling data. Possible solutions: estimate only height, limit runs to shorter periods
    and then integrate up component only over longer time span. Two options: 1) do this at the level of integration
    runs, op 2) also do the reduction and selection in two steps. Depends on known software issue [25 Jul 2024 by HM]
    to be solved.
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Major, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Only tested with waddenzee data (v6 and v7), not (yet) tested with Groningen data (only 
    with older software versions)
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    In v7, the newly added Shiermonnikoog levelling dataset causes a singularity during integration,
    has been excluded (temporarily) from the integration
[7 Jul 2024 by HM, Open, Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to none] 
    Tests on simulated data not yet ported to version 1.0 

Resolved in Release 1.0b1, 2 December 2024
------------------------------------------

[11 Jul 2024 by HB, Resolved ( 2 Dec 2024), Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to HM] 
    Contrary to what was reported in 00README_METEO.txt, the automatic download of 
    meteo data in the gnss2stm script seems to work again if https is used.
[11 Jul 2024 by HB, Resolved (2 Dec 2024), Minor, Prio Low, Assigned to HM] 
    Move shapefiles with basemaps from igpsoftware to a data directory 
[7 Jul 2024 by FvL, Resolved (27 Nov 2024), Major, Prio High, Assigned to FvL] 
    The prediction module has some known issues with co-located points (major, 
    under investigation, now resolved)



Ideas for new functionality and other major changes
---------------------------------------------------

- estimation of a 3D (space-time) model (e.g. spline-based) for the prediction step, instead of the current velocity and interpolation based approach
- add piece-wise linear of time based splines to stmvelocity (i.e. as the time dimension of the 3D space-time model)
- harmonizize stmvelocity, stmintegrate and stmpredict functionality (i.e. stmvelocity and stmpredict accept multiple 
input space time matrices)
- refactor stmintegrate
- possibly merge stmselect, stmreduce and stmintegrate to a single script/folder
